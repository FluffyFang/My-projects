# My-projects
A sample of programs I've made to showcase the types of projects I've worked on thus far.

ExampleGame contains all the information needed to run a game I worked on. A collegue did the spritework and I wrote the code. 
Initially, there were supposed to be 3 people working on the code, so I structured it to be simple to modify even during gameplay.

Hangman is a simple game of guessing a given word, letter by letter. 
The version I have uploaded is missing realistic word lists. The current files are merely placeholders for testing.

Phonebook is a simple implementation of database interfacing. 
While it can be a standalone program in its current form, your phone likely has a better one already.

Implementation of the Huffman algorithm was a class project and also my first foray into C#.
We were allowed to choose our language for this project. My partner was comfortable with the language and I was up for a challenge.
In the end, our implementation compressed the sample file most out of 7 other groups.
